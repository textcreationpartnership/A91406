            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>MASTER <hi>PIMMES</hi> Speech to the Lords in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, ſitting in Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter Hall, the twelfth of Aprill. 1641.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lords,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here hath beene much time ſpent to prove our Charge, and your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips have heard my Lord of Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords defence with as much patience. You have alſo heard our Evidence ſummed up whereby we have proved that he hath by trayterous words, Counſels and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, trayterouſly endevoured to ſubvert the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Lawes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in ſtead thereof, to introduce an arbitrary and tyrannicall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment againſt Law. This (my Lords) is that poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Arrow that hath tainted his bloud, this is that Cup of deadly wine that hath intoxicated him.</p>
            <p>My Lords, It comes to my ſhare to ſhew you how miſchievous an Act of Treaſon it is by that Law that he hath appealed unto, which is the ſupreme Law (to wit) publike good, for his Poſition was this, That <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus populi,</hi> is <hi>Suprema Lex.</hi> All Lawes are derived from
<pb facs="tcp:171481:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 130 -->this as its Fountaine, and end heere as its proper Center. And thoſe Actions that are oppoſite to this are againſt Law.</p>
            <p>Firſt, My Lords, It is ſuch an offence as compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all offences, ſuch a Treaſon as comprehends all treaſons.</p>
            <p>The earth (my Lords) is a Seminary of all flowers, ſo is this a Seminary of all offences.</p>
            <p>My Lords, this Law puts a difference betwixt good and evill; take away the Law (my Lords) and Nature becomes a Law to it ſelfe. As Pride will be a Law, Luſt will be a Law, Rapine a Law, Treaſon, a law, which Lawes have ruled in <hi>Ireland</hi> ever ſince my Lord came thither.</p>
            <p>Take away the Kings protection from the people, &amp; you take away the peoples allegiance to the King. Prerogative is the bounds of libertie, and (my Lords) they muſt not conteſt one againſt another.</p>
            <p>My Lords, I beſeech you conſider, ye have all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this cuſtodie; and if you take away this, you take away your goods, liberties and lives.</p>
            <p>My Lords, he ſaith, that <hi>Ireland</hi> was a conquered Nation, why? were not all Nations conquered? <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, Wales,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:171481:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <!-- PDF PAGE 130 -->
            <p>The next is this, that it is an offence full of danger to the Kings perſon and Crown, it nouriſheth diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and tumults in a people. If you conſider the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of the Nations under arbitrary government, you ſhall find them full of cruelty and bloudy Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres; yea, if you pleaſe to peruſe our Engliſh hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, you ſhall finde that when Arbitrary government was ſet up, how many Kings fell by cruell &amp; bloudy hands, which is fearefull to relate.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, my Lords, It is dangerous to the King, Firſt, in reſpect of his honour, Secondly, in reſpect of his profit, &amp; Thirdly, in reſpect of his greatneſſe: yet all theſe have beene put on upon the face of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as ſo many vizards, can it be (my Lords) for the Kings honour, to have his Miniſters to lay al the fault upon the King? To kill, to impriſon, to uſe Rapine, to levie warre againſt his people, and to ruine the State, and then all theſe diſhonourable acts to be layd on the King? Is this for the Kings honour?</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is contrary to his profit, for if there be not an affectionate ſupply from the people to the King, hee can never grow in his revenue.</p>
            <p>Nay, this (my Lords) is the Kings moſt certaine Revenue, that iſſues from the affection of his people, for other Revenue, as Lands, or the like, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to many Inconveniences, to many ſubſtractions and penſions, but this is free and wholly to himſelfe, theſe fourteene yeares paſt, ſince there hath beene an
<pb facs="tcp:171481:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 131 -->unhappy ceſſation of Parliamentary proceedings, the King hath had leſſe revenue, &amp; it doth him leſſe good.</p>
            <p>Nay, there hath beene more wanting to the King, than many yeares before. Againe, it is unprofitable, and that is worſe, for the King loſt by it, for it hath coſt him theſe two yeares more than it coſt Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in all her warres in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> yea, (I feare) more than is to be repayred in an age.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in point of greatneſſe; the World is a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of Kingdomes, and it is not enough for a King to be great at home, but to equall his fellow Princes abroad: Nay to be above them in honour and Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, in Riches and glory.</p>
            <p>But my Lords theſe Counſels of late that have bin given his Majeſty, have rendred him contemptible to his enemies, uſeleſſe to his diſtreſſed friends, and had they not beene prevented, in time would have made him uncapable of any deſigne at home or abroad.</p>
            <p>A fourth Conſideration is this, my Lords, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to wealth and valour; it corrupts our peace: and in peace, makes us have the malignities of warre, and for wealth; who will venture his goods, life, his libertie in the way of trading and Commerce, when he knowes not upon the returne of it, whether it be his owne or not.</p>
            <p>Nay, my Lords, it imbaſeth the ſpirits, and valour
<pb facs="tcp:171481:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 131 -->of a Nation, when they muſt ſtand in feare of pillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, ſcaffolding, and the like puniſhments, it makes men to be of baſe ſpirits.</p>
            <p>Now my Lords, to imbaſe the Kings Coyne, if it be but ſixe pence, or twelve pence, 'tis treaſon by the Law, and a man muſt die for it: what is it then to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe our ſpirits, my Lords? truly it is a matter of great importance.</p>
            <p>Fifthly it doth diſable the King, and makes him unfit to deale with forraigne enemies, for every one thinkes to ſlip his necke out of the Collar, when he ſhall be forced to it.</p>
            <p>The ſixt Conſideration is, that it is againſt the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant betwixt the King and his people.</p>
            <p>Before my Lords I ſpoke of a Legall Oath, but now I ſpeake of a perſonall, for we ſweare our alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to him, and he the maintenance of our Lawes to us: he is our husband, and we his wife; he is our Father, and we his children: he is to maintaine our liberties, and we his Dignities, and our duties.</p>
            <p>And my Lords, <hi>Iuſtice Thorpe</hi> was condemned and executed, for breaking the Kings Oath: My Lords, he broke not his owne oath, nor did the King breake his oath, and yet for violating that oath, that the King had taken to his Subjects, he ſuffered.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:171481:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <!-- PDF PAGE 132 -->
            <p>Ah what an unfortunate man then is the Priſoner at the Barre, that hath in all his Counſels, in all his words, in all his actions, broken the Kings Oath, and as much as in him lay, violently perſwaded the King to countenance him in all his actions?</p>
            <p>The ſeventh conſideration is this my Lords, it is againſt the end of government, for the end of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to preſerve men in their eſtates, lives, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, but an Arbitrary power deſtroyes all this: the end of government is to advance vertue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to puniſh vice: but this cheriſheth all diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>Now my Lords, I come to ſhew the vanitie of his excuſes, that he hath made for himſelfe.</p>
            <p>The firſt is the libertie of giving Counſell, being a Counſellor, true my Lords, he hath this liberty, but its bounded within its liſts, &amp; it muſt be ſuch a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell as muſt ſtand with the ſacred Majeſty, &amp; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and weale of his Subjects, for if Counſell be bad, it poyſons the Conſciences of Princes, it infects their eares, for all Government proceeds from the Prince, as from a Fountaine; now if the fountaine be poyſoned, how can the ſtreames be free?</p>
            <p>A ſecond ſhift is, that hee hopes your Lordſhips will be carefull to ſecure your poſteritie, and not to admit of this as Treaſon.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:171481:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <!-- PDF PAGE 132 -->
            <p>My Lords, I know your Lordſhips will be carefull to ſecure your ſelves, but by your vertues, not by your vices.</p>
            <p>The third excuſe is, the goodneſſe of his intentions: truly, my Lords, good and evill lye cloſe together, not eaſily to be diſcerned, if they be naturall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but for Murthers, Adultery, Rapines, and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, theſe are ſo monſtrous, that they may eaſily be diſtinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>And I cannot be perſwaded that ever hee intended well, that acted ſo ill.</p>
            <p>The fourth excuſe is the Kings neceſſities.</p>
            <p>My Lords this neceſſity came from his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>
            <p>A fifth excuſe is, that it was for the Kings honour, and the maintenance of the Kings power.</p>
            <p>My Lords, it hath beene declared unto you, that the Kings power doth not extend to any thing againſt Law, by which hee hath ſworne to rule us, and to maintaine our Liberties and priviledges for us, and this hath beene declared by five Parliaments, and alſo will appeare in the cafe of the Pitition of Right, and in the caſe of Ship-money.</p>
            <p>A ſixt is, that hee adviſed the King to doe it with
<pb facs="tcp:171481:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 133 -->moderation and reparation.</p>
            <p>My Lords this is a contradiction, for there can bee no reparation for this.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh excuſe is, that no horrid facts did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Counſels: truly my Lords we thanke God, his facred Majeſty, and his wiſe Counſell for that, or elſe God knowes what fearefull things would have befallen us, nor are we free from it as yet.</p>
            <p>To conclude, now my Lords, give me leave to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate you to conſider the Treaſons ordinarily practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when the act is done, they ceaſe as in killing that noble King of <hi>France,</hi> and the ſeverall plots againſt Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but this treaſon of my Lord of <hi>Straffords,</hi> is a ſtanding treaſon, which when it had beene done, it had beene permanent from generation to generation.</p>
            <p>And now my Lords, theſe Lawes that hee would have overthrown, muſt now be his Iudges, and hee is to be judg'd by Law, and that law will have marke enough of it to deſcribe it, for it is a Law againſt ſuch as breake the fundamentall Law of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>And my Lords give me leave to informe you that under favour this is not to make a new way for bloud, nor is the crime of Treaſon in my Lord of <hi>Strafford</hi> the leſſe, becauſe none would venture upon ſuch a horrid Treaſon, in two hundred and forty yeares.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:171481:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <!-- PDF PAGE 133 -->
            <p>But my Lords, for the making of our Charge good by Law, as wee have fully proved it by Teſtimony, we muſt reſort to Counſell with the houſe of Commons, and truſt to your Lordſhips Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
